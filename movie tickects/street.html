<h1>Street Dancer 3D</h1>
<h2>
<pre>
A dance epic based on the multifarious colors of dance and the unity that occurs between two different groups coming together
for a single cause. Set in London, the film is about 2 rival dance groups from India and Pakistan, who've been competing against 
each other every time they meet, be it at a cafe or at an underground street battle, until they eventually realize that they stem 
from the same roots and have a common purpose to stand for their people from the Asian subcontinent. Followed by the backdrop of a 
global dance competition, the film showcases how these underdogs stand strong against all odds.
